<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Mr. Frosty Man is a platformer where the player can create their own platforms using a water gun and a magic ice wand.</p>

<h5>Development Process</h5>
<p>This was a solo project developed over ~1.5 weeks as a rapid prottype for EECS 494 Project 2 at The University of Michigan.</p>
<p>In the first phase of this project, p2_goldspike, I worked on what I believed would be the hardest feature: the water gun. I developed the first level, player movement, water gun, ice wand, freezing mechanic, a simple UI, and the ice pick.</p>
<p>In the second phase of this project, p2_gold, I took some feedback into account and worked on a tutorial level to better guide players and reworked the control scheme. I also created a main menu that locks levels until the player has completed the previous one, a controls menu, added music, added sound effects, created three new levels, and created fire enemies.</p>
