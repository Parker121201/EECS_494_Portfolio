    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>'Kai: Lost Waters' is a 2D puzzle game where you help Kai master the power of water as they travel through a mysterious cavern. Use your mouse to move water however you like and solve puzzles by powering technology belonging to an ancient civilization.</p>

    <h5>Development Process</h5>
    <p>This was a project developed over ~6 weeks by a group of 5 for EECS 494 Project 3 at The University of Michigan.</p>
    <p>Our initial game plan involved the player being able to control 4 elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. In this first week, I worked on the fire element. I created two fire abilities and interactable torches.</p>
    <p>In the following week, we pivoted to focus solely on water as this was our strongest mechanic. Other major project changes involved using a tilemap to create our game scenes and scaling down the level size significantly to focus on player guidance.</p>
    
    <h5>Contributions</h5>
    <p>Throughout the project, I worked heavily on level design and creation, puzzle design, I created the title screen, and I created the credits scene.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I spent a lot of time in team meetings contributing to decision on game direction and project management</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Mr. Frosty Man is a platformer where the player can create their own platforms using a water gun and a magic ice wand.</p>

    <h5>Development Process</h5>
    <p>This was a solo project developed over ~1.5 weeks as a rapid prottype for EECS 494 Project 2 at The University of Michigan.</p>
    <p>In the first phase of this project, p2_goldspike, I worked on what I believed would be the hardest feature: the water gun. I developed the first level, player movement, water gun, ice wand, freezing mechanic, a simple UI, and the ice pick.</p>
    <p>In the second phase of this project, p2_gold, I took some feedback into account and worked on a tutorial level to better guide players and reworked the control scheme. I also created a main menu that locks levels until the player has completed the previous one, a controls menu, added music, added sound effects, created three new levels, and created fire enemies.</p>
